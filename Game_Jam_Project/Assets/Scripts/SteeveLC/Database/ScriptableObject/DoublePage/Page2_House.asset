    pagetext: "A vision of sorrow, the heart of this world tourment.\r\n\r\nThe Discovery
      of a cold body, the only one he wished not to,\r\n\r\nCreated a crossroad with
      paths leading either to an end or a new start.\r\n\r\nBut peace must be reached
      within self first, by lying to rest what must. "

    pagetext: "A piece of soul was gone to early, no pain can match what it must be.\r\n\r\nA
      single inattention, and a fate was sealed,\r\n\r\nIn the weight of the guilt
      lies the true trial.\r\n\r\nAnd so starts the battle between two endings."
